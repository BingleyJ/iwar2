	"iwar-test.agi" is a simple AGI (Asterisk Gateway Interface) routine
that allows for testing iWar2 for bugs when used with a old serial based
modem.  Rather than test iWar2 by making real calls out on the PSTN via modem,  
this AGI simply "acts" like the call is being placed on the PSTN by a set of 
recordings.  

	With this setup,  you can "tweak" your VoIP/Asterisk setup without
ever actually making a call.  This _requires_ that you have a modem and a
VoIP ATA/PAP2 device that connects to a Asterisk server!

The AGI is very, very simple.  

Installation:
-------------

1.  Copy all the sound files to the Asterisk sound directory (as root).

# cp *.wav /var/lib/asterisk/en/sounds/

2.  Copy "iwar-test.agi" to the Asterisk AGI directory.

# cp iwar-test.agi /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/

3.  Make sure "iwar-test.agi" is executable. 

# chmod 755 /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/iwar-test.agi

4.  Add the following line into your /etc/extensions.conf dial plan (or
    something similar).

exten => _919555.,1,Answer
exten => _919555.,n,AGI(iwar-test.agi)
exten => _919555.,n,Hangup

5.  Reload Asterisk.


What does this do?
------------------

	When your modem picks up (on the ATA) and dials anything like
9195551000,   that AGI will handle the call.   You can now test iWar2
with a range like thus:

# iwar2 -m 91955510XX
